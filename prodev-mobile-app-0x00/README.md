# Mobile App Dev Documentation

Started a new application using the Expo Router template:  
`npx create-expo-app@latest`

Launched the application:  
`npx expo start`

Reset the project using:  
`npm run reset-project`  
This moved the scaffolded files into a new folder named `app-example`.

After resetting, the `index.tsx` file was clean and ready for a fresh start.  
Re-ran the app using:  
`npx expo start`
